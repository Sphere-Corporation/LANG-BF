# Operation

## Getting Started

Ensure that you have the Brainf**k tape loaded, either using a virtual Sphere-1 or a physical cassette.

Either way, you should load using:

```python
    L           
    BF 0200     <ESC>
```

Once the Brainf**k interpreter is loaded, a simple prompt is presented.

The following keystrokes can be used at various times (depending on the mode).

|Key| Function              |
|-------|-----------------------|
| **\<ENTER>**   |  Enter a new line into the editor. |
| **\<ESCAPE>**   |  ESCape from the editor back to the prompt line. |
| **\<CTRL-I>**   |  Toggle between program and tape view in the edtor. |
| **R**   |  Only at the prompt, run the currently loaded program |
| **E**   |  At the prompt, pressing "E" will enter the editor with the program loaded. |
| **CURSORS**   | Move around within the editor space. |
